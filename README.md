# Data Model üìä <a name="idModel"></a>

_On this section I will explain about the Database_


### Entities ‚ú®
* User: This user have an id(pk) then have a name, last name, email and password.

* Address: This address have an id(pk) then have a street, number, zipCode, location, province, country.

* Order: This order have an id(pk) then have a date, total and status.

* Products: This products have and id(pk) then have a name, description, price, taxRate, image, category, availability.

---

<br><br>


### Relationships üîå 

* A user have a lot of orders but an order have only one user

* An order contains a lot of products and products have a lot of orders

* A user have only one address but an addres have a lot of users

<br><br>

_Now I'll show you the E/R diagram and the Relational Model_
<br><br>

## E/R DIAGRAM

</p>

## Relational Model
<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="E-commerce ER\E-R Relacional Final Tandem.png" alt="RelationalModel" >
</p>
<br><br>

Here are the tables with the E/R to Relational

* Address: ( id(pk), street, number, zipCode, location, province, country )

* User:  ( id(pk), name, lastName, email, password, isAdmin, timestamp, id_address(fk) )

* Order Product: ( id_product(fk), id_user(fk), timestamp )

* Orders: ( id(pk), date, total, status, timestamp, id_user(fk) )

* Products: ( id(pk), name, description, price, taxRate, image, category, availability 
)

<br><br>

## User Requirement <a name ="idRequirements"></a> üë§
    Web Aplication


    If you are a guest, you will see the catalogue, home, 
    contact page and you can log-in and register also
    you can see your side-meno by your role "guest"

    If you are a user, you will see the catalogue and you can add products and buy it, you can go to

    your profile and there you can add address, edit update(not recommended yet) and log out, you can
    go to contact page, and see your side-menu by your role "user"

    If you are an admin, you will see the same features like user but you can add, edit and
    delete products and finally you can edit and remove the tracing of users

_This gonna be the main view where you can use three buttons, one to go to the catalogue then one to log-in or log-out and finally one to go to the contact page_
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="img\catalogueView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

_This is the catalogue page, here if you are guest, you can't go to profile and add to cart/payment but if you are a user you can do it_
<br><br><br><br><br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\cartView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>


_Here is the cart list, here you cand checkout your order and will send the order to the backend_

## Usability <a name="idUsability"></a> üìù

<br><br><br>

* _Useful: that it is capable of fulfilling the specific tasks for which it has been designed. Example (Being an admin you can do a lot of features)_ 

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\adminView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>
<br><br><br>

* _Easy to use: it must be efficient, fast and with as few errors as possible. 
Comfortable to use. You can understand easily the menus and the app._

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\allTaskView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _Easy to learn: no excessive time is needed to learn how to work with the application and it is easy to remember how it works. 
Easy to understand_
<br><br><br><br><br>


<br><br><br>

* _Elegant in its design: to favour the user's perception and emotions._
<p align="center">
    <img src="img\mainView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>


* _It is efficient: It measures the effort to achieve an objective._

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\loggedView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _The user must be able to initiate actions and control tasks_

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\checkoutView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _The user must be able to customize the interface, the use can change the theme between light and dark_


<p align="center">
    <img src="img\darkMode.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _The user must be able to access all the content, here you have 3 roles: guest, user, admin and you can access to the content_

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\allTaskView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _Error recovery
Minimise the risk of accidental actions (e.g. typing an email to ensure that the @ is present, putting a surname to ensure that it is not left blank)
Enabling stock reversal and recovery
Take into account potential user errors._

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\invalidRegister.png" alt="MainView" width="320" >
</p>

<br><br><br>

* _Simplicity of design
No overloading the interface with unnecessary elements
The information in the interface will be the minimum essential
The interface will be SIMPLE and easy to learn and remember_

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\designView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>


<br><br><br>


* _Feedback
Appropriate response to user actions_

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\loggedView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>


<br><br><br>


* _Colour. Colour should be considered as an additional tool in design, not a basic need. A limited set of colours is recommended, with subtle, complementary, muted colours being most appropriate in the design of business and academic interfaces._ 

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\cartView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br>


* _Form-type window layout. The visual location of the components is important because the relationship between the components is indicated by their position. A clean layout is crucial to create a smooth visual flow of information for the user._

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\registerView.png" alt="MainView" >
</p>

<br><br><br> 

* _Consistency. Whenever possible, the interface should be consistent. This implies that similar operations will have to be activated in the same way. Furthermore, ergonomics should be taken into account through menus, action bars and icons that are easy to access and identify._ 

<p align="center">
    <img src="img\cartView.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >
    <br><br>
    <img src="img\sideMenu.png" width="200"  alt="MainView" >
    <br><br>
    <img src="img\icons.png" alt="MainView" >
    
</p>
<br><br><br>

* _Recallability. The interface must include mechanisms to allow users to recover from errors. Example (you as admin can edit the tracking of the user's order, you can cancel and recover from errors_

<br><br>

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

_For this project I use Ionic, Node js and MySQL_

* [Ionic](ionicframework.com) - Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013. The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. However, the latest release was re-built as a set of Web Components, allowing the user to choose any user interface framework, such as Angular, React or Vue.js.
<br><br>


* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting‚Äîrunning scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
<br><br>

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.
